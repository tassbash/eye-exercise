Eye Exercise

This project is an in-browser interactive set of eyes. Simple and minimalistic - move your mouse and the eyes will follow!

How to Run: Download the repository files on computer. Make sure all the files are included (.css file, .html file, & .js file). Once downloaded, simply run the .html file in your browser.

Roadmap of future improvements: Add a randomized generator to randomize styling to the eyes like eyelashes, wrinkles, color, and beauty marks.
